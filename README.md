I had a few issues getting started on this project. Once I found the correct lecture video, it was fairly straightforward. I did need some help from Professor Ram figuring out how to add two ES6 strings at one time to the HTML template and then with some naming conventions. 

I used W3schools for some sorting array help and common CSS tricks. I used transparenttextures.com and vecteezy.com for my background image and my icons.
